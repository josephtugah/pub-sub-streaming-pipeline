GCP Data Engineering Project: Streaming Data Pipeline with Pub/Sub and Apache Beam/Dataflow
Google Cloud Pub/Sub is a fully managed messaging service designed to support real-time messaging between applications. It enables reliable, asynchronous communication by decoupling senders and receivers, making it ideal for building event-driven systems.

Dataflow is a Google Cloud service that provides unified stream and batch data processing at scale. Use Dataflow to create data pipelines that read from one or more sources, transform the data, and write the data to a destination. Dataflow is built on the open source Apache Beam project. Apache Beam lets you write pipelines using a language-specific SDK. Apache Beam supports Java, Python, and Go SDKs, as well as multi-language pipelines. Dataflow executes Apache Beam pipelines. If you decide later to run your pipeline on a different platform, such as Apache Flink or Apache Spark, you can do so without rewriting the pipeline code. The following is a challenging task I came across and the corresponding solution I developed
